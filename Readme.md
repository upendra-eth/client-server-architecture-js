## Introduction

Client-server architecture is a common approach in web development, where the application is divided into two major parts: the client-side and the server-side. The client-side handles the user interface and interacts with the end-users, while the server-side manages data processing, storage, and communication with other services or databases.

This repository is designed to be a learning resource for web developers of all levels. It will include a collection of projects, each demonstrating a different aspect of the client-server architecture. Whether you are a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals or an experienced developer seeking advanced concepts, you'll find something valuable here.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the project directory of the specific project you want to explore.
3. Review the project's README for specific setup instructions and requirements.

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine, as many projects will utilize it for the server-side implementation.
